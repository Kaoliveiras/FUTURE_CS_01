 # Task 1: Web Application Security Testing

## 🛡️ About the Task
In this hands-on cybersecurity internship project, I'll perform vulnerability assessment of a real-world or open-source web application. The goal is to identify security flaws using ethical hacking tools and OWASP standards. This project simulates real client work for startups, SaaS companies, or e-commerce platforms that need to secure their websites.

I'll learn how hackers target websites—and how to defend them. My findings will be compiled into a professional security report for my portfolio.

## ✅ What I'll Do
- [ ] Set up and explore a test web app (DVWA or OWASP Juice Shop)
- [ ] Use scanning tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or Nikto
- [ ] Test for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
- [ ] Map vulnerabilities to OWASP Top 10 threats
- [ ] Document findings with screenshots, impact level, and remediation steps
- [ ] Compile a Security Assessment Report (PDF format)

## 🎯 Skills I'll Gain
- 🔓 Web application vulnerability scanning
- 📄 Security documentation and reporting
- ⚔️ Knowledge of OWASP Top 10 threats
- 🧠 Basic ethical hacking and penetration testing
- 🔍 Threat modeling and risk analysis

## 🛠️ Tools I'll Use
- **OWASP ZAP** - Open-source vulnerability scanner
- **Burp Suite (Community Edition)** - Web app testing toolkit
- **SQLMap** - SQL injection tool
- **DVWA** - Damn Vulnerable Web Application
- **OWASP Juice Shop** - Modern vulnerable app

## 📁 Applications to Test
- 🧪 OWASP Juice Shop - Modern, gamified web security testing
- ⚠️ DVWA - Lightweight and popular for local testing
- 🧩 bWAPP - Buggy web app with 100+ vulnerabilities

## 📝 Final Deliverables
- [ ] PDF Security Report with risk rating and suggestions
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 Compliance checklist
- [ ] Tool logs (ZAP scan reports, Burp Suite issues)
- [ ] Screenshots of vulnerabilities and mitigation steps
